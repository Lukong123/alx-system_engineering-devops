### Root Causse and Resolution
The website had some repeated pages and in order to make the backend and the website less complicated, these duplicated and repeated pages had to be deleted permanently. While deleting different products and pages the deleted link was still used to refer to key pages on the site as a result those pages returned a 404 error.
The issue was fixed by going back to the WordPress dashboard, reviewing the parent pages of the problematic page, and checking the link which is contained, once the wrong link was discovered, the correct link was inserted instead of the wrong one.
## Corrective and Preventative Measures.
- In order to avoid this problem, the following can be done:
- Organize the structure of the site before creating pages.
- When a page is deleted, the parent page should be updated by removing the broken link.
